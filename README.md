We redesigned the UI with optimized font sizes and line spacing for a more elegant and clean presentation.
All of these features are also seamlessly displayed on Android and macOS with native UI

> Note: Some animated images have been sped up for demonstration. If you experience lag, please view on Chrome, Firefox,

## Architecture

![](/assets/architecture.avif)

By default, we use **AWS App Runner**, which is commonly used to host Python FastAPI servers, offering high performance,
scalability and low latency.

Alternatively, we provide the option to replace App Runner with **AWS Lambda** using Function URL for a more
cost-effective
solution, as shown in
this [example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter/tree/main/examples/fastapi-response-streaming).

## Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models. SwiftChat default settings are:

- Region: `us-west-2`
- Chat Model: `Amazon Nova Pro`
- Image Model: `Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large`

If you are using the image generation feature, please make sure you have enabled access to the `Amazon Nova Lite` model.
Please follow
the [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to
enable your models.

4. Click **Create parameter**.

### Step 2: Deploy stack and get your API URL

1. Click one of the following buttons to launch the CloudFormation Stack in the same region where your API Key was
   created.

    - **Lambda** (Note: For AWS customer use only)

      [![Launch Stack](assets/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatLambda&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatLambda.template)

2. Click **Next**, On the "Specify stack details" page, provide the following information:
    - Fill the `ApiKeyParam` with the parameter name you used for storing the API key (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey").

3. Click **Next**, Keep the "Configure stack options" page as default, Read the Capabilities and Check the "I
   acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources" checkbox at the bottom.
4. Click **Next**, In the "Review and create" Review your configuration and click **Submit**.

Wait about 3-5 minutes for the deployment to finish, then click the CloudFormation stack and go to **Outputs** tab, you
can find the **API URL** which looks like: `https://xxx.xxx.awsapprunner.com` or `https://xxx.lambda-url.xxx.on.aws`

### Step 3: Open the App and setup with API URL and API Key

1. Launch the App, open the drawer menu, and tap **Settings**.
2. Paste the `API URL` and `API Key`(The **Value** you typed in Parameter Store) then select the Region.
3. Click the top right ✓ icon to save your configuration and start your chat.

Do not include XML tags or other markup.\n<task sequence=6>\n  <message type=user>\n    debug this program\n    execute npx react-native run-android\n  </message>\n  \n  <message type=ai>\n    I can see this is a React Native application with both frontend and backend components. To debug the program when running `npx react-native run-android`, I need to understand what specific issues you're encountering.\n    \n    Based on my analysis of the codebase, I found extensive debug logging and error handling throughout the application, but I need more information to provide targeted debugging help.\n    \n    ## Questions to clarify the debugging scope:\n    \n    1. **What specific error or issue are you seeing** when running `npx react-native run-android`?\n       - Build failures?\n       - Runtime crashes?\n       - Network connectivity issues?\n       - Specific feature not working?\n    \n    2. **What is the exact error message or behavior** you're experiencing?\n    \n    3. **Are you having issues with:**\n       - The React Native app startup?\n       - The Python FastAPI server connection?\n       - Specific features like voice chat, file upload, or AI model integration?\n    \n    From the debug analysis I performed, the most common issues in this codebase are related to:\n    \n    - **Network connectivity** (API timeouts, stream reading failures)\n    - **Authentication** (API key validation, token issues)\n    - **Audio processing** (microphone permissions, recording failures)\n    - **File operations** (video compression, file sharing)\n    - **Stream processing** (JSON parsing, data chunk errors)\n    \n    Once you provide the specific error or issue you're encountering, I can give you targeted debugging steps and potentially propose code fixes using *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n    \n    Could you please share:\n    1. The exact command output/error when running `npx react-native run-android`\n    2. Any relevant logs from the Metro bundler or Android logcat\n    3. What specific functionality isn't working as expected\n  </message>\n  \n  <message type=custom>\n    \n    # Code Agent Finished\n    No edits found or applied in response, and no changes since last build; ending task.\n  </message>\n</task>\n\n"

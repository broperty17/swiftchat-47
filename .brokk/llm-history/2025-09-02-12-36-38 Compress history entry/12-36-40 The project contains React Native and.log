      # Planning
      I need to explore the project structure to find all main programs, executables, or entry points. Let me start by searching for common entry point patterns and exploring the project structure.
      ```üîç Searching for filenames
      patterns:
        - .*main\..*
        - .*index\..*
        - .*app\..*
        - .*App\..*
        - package\.json
        - .*\.config\..*
      reasoning: Looking for common entry point files like main.*, index.*, App.*, package.json, and config files that might indicate project structure and entry points
      ```
      Matching filenames: react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/theme/index.ts, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/index.js, react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m, server/src/main.py, react-native/android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/app.json, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/package.json
      ```üîç Searching for substrings
      patterns:
        - "main":\s*"[^"]*"
        - "scripts":\s*\{
        - public static void main
        - if __name__ == "__main__"
        - def main\(
        - function main\(
        - export default
        - module\.exports
      reasoning: Searching for entry point patterns in various languages - Node.js main field, scripts in package.json, Java main method, Python main, JavaScript/TypeScript exports
      ```
      Files with content matching patterns: react-native/.eslintrc.js, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageProgressBar.tsx, react-native/.prettierrc.js, server/src/main.py, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Markdown.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Parser.tsx, react-native/src/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomSendComponent.tsx, react-native/src/history/CustomDrawerContent.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/AudioWaveformComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/DropdownComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TabButton.tsx, react-native/src/prompt/PromptScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/useMarkdown.ts, react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/prompt/PresetPromptList.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/CustomCodeHighlighter.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageSpinner.tsx, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomMessageComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TokenUsageScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/HeaderTitle.tsx, react-native/src/chat/ChatScreen.tsx, react-native/package.json, react-native/src/settings/CustomTextInput.tsx

      # Main Programs, Executables, and Entry Points for Debugging
      
      This project contains multiple main programs and entry points across different platforms and technologies. Here are all the key entry points that might need debugging:
      
      ## 1. React Native Application Entry Points
      
      ### Primary JavaScript Entry Point
      - **File:** `react-native/index.js`
      - **Purpose:** Main React Native application entry point
      - **Key Code:** `AppRegistry.registerComponent('BropertyAi', () => App)`
      - **Imports:** App component from `./src/App`
      
      ### Main App Component
      - **File:** `react-native/src/App.tsx` (already in workspace)
      - **Purpose:** Root React component with navigation, theming, and providers
      - **Key Features:**
        - Navigation setup with drawer and stack navigators
        - Theme provider integration
        - App context provider
        - Toast notifications
        - Multiple screen components (ChatScreen, TokenUsageScreen, PromptScreen, etc.)
      
      ### iOS Native Entry Point
      - **File:** `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`
      - **Purpose:** iOS-specific native application entry point
      - **Key Code:** `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` function
      - **Delegates to:** AppDelegate class via UIApplicationMain
      
      ## 2. Python FastAPI Server Entry Point
      
      ### Main Server Application
      - **File:** `server/src/main.py`
      - **Purpose:** Backend API server using FastAPI
      - **Key Code:** `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
      - **Server Startup:** `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", "8080")))`
      - **Configuration:** Configurable port via PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
      
      ### Image Processing Module
      - **File:** `server/src/image_nl_processor.py`
      - **Purpose:** Supporting module for image processing functionality
      - **Note:** May contain additional entry points or main functions for image processing tasks
      
      ## 3. Development and Build Entry Points
      
      ### Package.json Scripts (react-native/package.json)
      These are executable commands that serve as entry points for various development tasks:
      
      #### Development Entry Points:
      - `"start": "react-native start"` - Metro bundler for development
      - `"android": "react-native run-android"` - Android app launcher
      - `"ios": "react-native run-ios"` - iOS app launcher
      
      #### Build Entry Points:
      - `"build:ios": "cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace BropertyAi.xcworkspace..."` - iOS production build
      
      #### Testing/Quality Entry Points:
      - `"test": "jest"` - Jest test runner
      - `"lint": "npx eslint ."` - ESLint code linting
      - `"format": "npx prettier --check '*.{js,ts}'"` - Prettier code formatting check
      
      ## 4. Configuration Entry Points
      
      These configuration files can affect application behavior and may need debugging:
      
      - **react-native/jest.config.js** - Jest testing configuration
      - **react-native/babel.config.js** - Babel transpilation configuration  
      - **react-native/metro.config.js** - Metro bundler configuration
      - **react-native/.eslintrc.js** - ESLint linting configuration
      
      ## Application Details
      
      - **App Name:** "BropertyAi"
      - **Version:** "2.4.0" 
      - **Architecture:** React Native frontend with FastAPI Python backend
      - **Platforms:** iOS and Android mobile apps
      
      ## Debugging Priority
      
      For debugging purposes, focus on these primary entry points in order of importance:
      
      1. **React Native App (`react-native/src/App.tsx`)** - Main UI and navigation logic
      2. **FastAPI Server (`server/src/main.py`)** - Backend API and business logic
      3. **Platform-specific entry points** (`react-native/index.js`, `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`) - Platform initialization
      4. **Development scripts** (package.json scripts) - Build and development issues
      
      Each of these entry points controls different aspects of the application lifecycle and would be key locations for debugging application startup, runtime issues, or build problems.

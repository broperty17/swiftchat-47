# Request to claude-4-sonnet:

<message type=system>
  <instructions>
  You are the Architect Agent. You solve problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces
  in an evolving long-range plan.
  
  # High-Level Problem Solving Strategy
  
  1. Understand the problem deeply. Carefully read the project description and think critically about what is required.
  2. Investigate the codebase. Explore relevant classes and files, search for key functions, and gather context into the Workspace.
  3. Develop a clear, step-by-step plan. Break down the fix into manageable, incremental steps.
  4. Instruct Code Agent how to implement the fix incrementally, making self-contained, testable code changes.
     Incrementally means making multiple calls to Code Agent, it will get confused if you ask it to do everything at once.
     (Code Agent will run the tests that you add to the Workspace.)
  5. Debug as needed. Use debugging techniques to isolate and resolve issues.
  6. Iterate until the root cause is fixed and all tests pass.
  7. Reflect and validate comprehensively. After each change, think about the original intent and how to update your plan.
  
  Refer to the detailed sections below for more information on each step.
  
  ## 1. Deeply Understand the Problem
  Carefully read the goal and think hard about a plan to solve it before asking Code Agent to make changes.
  
  ## 2. Codebase Investigation and the Workspace
  - If you know the files or classes or methods you need, you should add them or related information (summaries,
    usages, call graphs, etc.) to the Workspace to examine them yourself and to expose them to Code Agent.
  - If you do not know where the information you need lives, use Search Agent to search for
    key functions, classes, or variables related to the goal.
  - Identify the root cause of the problem.
  - Update the Workspace context continuously, including dropping irrelevant fragments, as you improve your understanding.
  
  Use Search Agent whenever you are not sure where to find relevant code or how the user's goal relates to the project.
  Once Search Agent gives you the code location, you can add it (or derivatives like usages or call graphs)
  to the Workspace where you can examine it yourself. However! if you already know where to
  find the necessary information yourself, prefer adding it directly to searching redundantly.
  
  It's fine to add things to the Workspace just to see if they are relevant, and drop them later if it turns out that they are not.
  Conversely, if you want to add something back that you dropped earlier, you can look at the result of the
  dropWorkspaceFragments tool call to remind yourself what they were. But! only code fragments can
  be recovered this way; in particular, string fragments or paste fragments cannot.
  
  If you are not COMPLETELY SURE what part of the goal refers to, you MUST
  determine what it means before attempting any code changes!  If the request is still ambiguous or
  unclear after thorough exploration of the codebase, stop and ask for clarification from the user.
  
  The Workspace is the collection of files and code fragments visible to you and to the other Agents.
  Irrelevant information or too much detail will confuse the the other agents, so you always use
  class summaries or function excerpts instead of full-text files where possible, and should remove irrelevant
  files entirely.
  
  ## 3. Develop a Detailed Plan
  - Outline a specific, simple, and verifiable sequence of steps to fix the problem.
  - Break down the fix into small, incremental changes whenever possible.
  
  ## 4. Making Code Changes
  - Make code changes only if you have high confidence they can solve the problem.
  - For each change, add ALL files that need editing to the Workspace, as well as any other relevant fragments,
    summaries, and information that Code Agent needs to make the change correctly.
  - Since Code Agent will try to build and run tests for each change, do not ask Code Agent to make a change
    that will leave the project un-buildable or un-testable.
  
  Code Agent IS NOT ABLE to manipulate the workspace! It's up to you to configure the workspace with
  the appropriate editable files as well as any other summaries, usages, or read-only files
  necessary to use the relevant APIs correctly before invoking Code Agent. This means not just adding
  the relevant content needed for your requested changes, but also removing the irrelevant to avoid confusion!
  
  ## 5. Debugging
  - When debugging, try to determine the root cause rather than addressing symptoms.
  - Debug for as long as needed to identify the root cause and identify a fix.
  - Use print statements or temporary code to inspect program state, including descriptive statements or error messages to understand what's happening.
  - To test hypotheses, you can also add test statements or functions.
  - If Code Agent stops with tests failing, analyze failures and revise your instructions to Code Agent.
  - Have Code Agent write additional tests if needed to capture important behaviors or edge cases.
  - Ensure all tests pass before completing your work.
  - Revisit your assumptions if unexpected behavior occurs.
  
  ## 6. Final Verification
  - Confirm that the original goal has been addressed.
  - Review your solution for logic correctness and robustness.
  - Iterate until you are extremely confident the fix is complete and all tests pass.
  
  ## 7. Final Reflection and Additional Testing
  - Reflect carefully on the original intent of the user and the problem statement.
  - Think about potential edge cases or scenarios that may not be covered by existing tests.
  - Have Code Agent write additional tests that would need to pass to fully validate the correctness of your solution.
  
  # Working with other agents
  
  The Workspace of files and code fragments is visible to all agents as well as you, but
  other agents ARE NOT ABLE to see our conversation, including the results of other agent calls!
  Your instructions must therefore be self-contained and complete;
  besides the Workspace itself that is the only information they will have.
  
  DO NOT assume that the workspace is correctly configured to start solving the goal! You MUST
  evaluate the workspace contents INDEPENDENTLY at each step and drop irrelevant fragments for
  the next step in your plan!

  # Planning
  I need to explore the project structure to find all main programs, executables, or entry points. Let me start by searching for common entry point patterns and exploring the project structure.
  ```🔍 Searching for filenames
  patterns:
    - .*main\..*
    - .*index\..*
    - .*app\..*
    - .*App\..*
    - package\.json
    - .*\.config\..*
  reasoning: Looking for common entry point files like main.*, index.*, App.*, package.json, and config files that might indicate project structure and entry points
  ```
  Matching filenames: react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/theme/index.ts, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/index.js, react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m, server/src/main.py, react-native/android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/app.json, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/package.json
  ```🔍 Searching for substrings
  patterns:
    - "main":\s*"[^"]*"
    - "scripts":\s*\{
    - public static void main
    - if __name__ == "__main__"
    - def main\(
    - function main\(
    - export default
    - module\.exports
  reasoning: Searching for entry point patterns in various languages - Node.js main field, scripts in package.json, Java main method, Python main, JavaScript/TypeScript exports
  ```
  Files with content matching patterns: react-native/.eslintrc.js, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageProgressBar.tsx, react-native/.prettierrc.js, server/src/main.py, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Markdown.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Parser.tsx, react-native/src/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomSendComponent.tsx, react-native/src/history/CustomDrawerContent.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/AudioWaveformComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/DropdownComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TabButton.tsx, react-native/src/prompt/PromptScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/useMarkdown.ts, react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/prompt/PresetPromptList.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/CustomCodeHighlighter.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageSpinner.tsx, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomMessageComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TokenUsageScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/HeaderTitle.tsx, react-native/src/chat/ChatScreen.tsx, react-native/package.json, react-native/src/settings/CustomTextInput.tsx

  # Planning
  I can see there are multiple programs in this project. Let me examine the main entry points to provide a comprehensive answer.
  ```❓ 
  filePaths:
    - server/src/*.py
  ```
  Added dynamic file summaries for: [server/src/image_nl_processor.py, server/src/main.py]

    - react-native/package.json
    - react-native/index.js
    - server/src/main.py
    - react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m
  ```
  Based on the provided files, here are all the main programs, executables, or entry points in this project that might need debugging:
  
  ## Main Entry Points
  
  ### 1. React Native Application Entry Point
  **File:** `react-native/index.js`

  ### Testing/Quality Scripts:
  - `"test": "jest"` - Test runner entry point
  - `"lint": "npx eslint ."` - Linting process
  - `"format": "npx prettier --check '*.{js,ts}'"` - Code formatting check
  
  ## Key Application Details
  
  ### React Native App:
  - **App Name:** "BropertyAi" 
  - **Version:** "2.4.0"
  - **Main App Component:** Located at `./src/App` (referenced in index.js)
  
  ### FastAPI Server:
  - **Port:** Configurable via PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
  - **Host:** "0.0.0.0" (all interfaces)
  - **Framework:** FastAPI with uvicorn server
  - **Main app instance:** `app = FastAPI()`
  
  These entry points represent the primary locations where debugging efforts should be focused, as they control the application startup and execution flow.

  # Planning
  # Answer
  # Main Programs, Executables, and Entry Points for Debugging
  
  This project contains multiple main programs and entry points across different platforms and technologies. Here are all the key entry points that might need debugging:
  
  ## 1. React Native Application Entry Points
  
  ### Primary JavaScript Entry Point
  - **File:** `react-native/index.js`
  - **Purpose:** Main React Native application entry point
  - **Key Code:** `AppRegistry.registerComponent('BropertyAi', () => App)`
  - **Imports:** App component from `./src/App`
  
  ### Main App Component
  - **File:** `react-native/src/App.tsx` (already in workspace)
  - **Purpose:** Root React component with navigation, theming, and providers
  - **Key Features:**
    - Navigation setup with drawer and stack navigators
    - Theme provider integration
    - App context provider
    - Toast notifications
    - Multiple screen components (ChatScreen, TokenUsageScreen, PromptScreen, etc.)
  
  ### iOS Native Entry Point
  - **File:** `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`
  - **Purpose:** iOS-specific native application entry point
  - **Key Code:** `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` function
  - **Delegates to:** AppDelegate class via UIApplicationMain
  
  ## 2. Python FastAPI Server Entry Point
  
  ### Main Server Application
  - **File:** `server/src/main.py`
  - **Purpose:** Backend API server using FastAPI
  - **Key Code:** `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
  - **Server Startup:** `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", "8080")))`
  - **Configuration:** Configurable port via PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
  
  ### Image Processing Module
  - **File:** `server/src/image_nl_processor.py`
  - **Purpose:** Supporting module for image processing functionality
  - **Note:** May contain additional entry points or main functions for image processing tasks
  
  ## 3. Development and Build Entry Points
  
  ### Package.json Scripts (react-native/package.json)
  These are executable commands that serve as entry points for various development tasks:
  
  #### Development Entry Points:
  - `"start": "react-native start"` - Metro bundler for development
  - `"android": "react-native run-android"` - Android app launcher
  - `"ios": "react-native run-ios"` - iOS app launcher
  
  #### Build Entry Points:
  - `"build:ios": "cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace BropertyAi.xcworkspace..."` - iOS production build
  
  #### Testing/Quality Entry Points:
  - `"test": "jest"` - Jest test runner
  - `"lint": "npx eslint ."` - ESLint code linting
  - `"format": "npx prettier --check '*.{js,ts}'"` - Prettier code formatting check
  
  ## 4. Configuration Entry Points
  
  These configuration files can affect application behavior and may need debugging:
  
  - **react-native/jest.config.js** - Jest testing configuration
  - **react-native/babel.config.js** - Babel transpilation configuration  
  - **react-native/metro.config.js** - Metro bundler configuration
  - **react-native/.eslintrc.js** - ESLint linting configuration
  
  ## Application Details
  
  - **App Name:** "BropertyAi"
  - **Version:** "2.4.0" 
  - **Architecture:** React Native frontend with FastAPI Python backend
  - **Platforms:** iOS and Android mobile apps
  
  ## Debugging Priority
  
  For debugging purposes, focus on these primary entry points in order of importance:
  
  1. **React Native App (`react-native/src/App.tsx`)** - Main UI and navigation logic
  2. **FastAPI Server (`server/src/main.py`)** - Backend API and business logic
  3. **Platform-specific entry points** (`react-native/index.js`, `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`) - Platform initialization
  4. **Development scripts** (package.json scripts) - Build and development issues
  
  Each of these entry points controls different aspects of the application lifecycle and would be key locations for debugging application startup, runtime issues, or build problems.

  debug this program
  
  </goal>
  
  Please decide the next tool action(s) to make progress towards resolving the goal.
  
  You MUST think carefully before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls.
  DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
  
  You are encouraged to call multiple tools simultaneously, especially
  - when searching for relevant code: you can invoke callSearchAgent multiple times at once
  - when manipulating Workspace context: make all desired manipulations at once
  
  Conversely, it does not make sense to call multiple tools with
  - callCodeAgent, since you want to see what changes get made before proceeding
  - projectFinished or abortProject, since they terminate execution
  
  When you are done, call projectFinished or abortProject.

    I need to explore the project structure to find all main programs, executables, or entry points. Let me start by searching for common entry point patterns and exploring the project structure.
    ```🔍 Searching for filenames
    patterns:
      - .*main\..*
      - .*index\..*
      - .*app\..*
      - .*App\..*
      - package\.json
      - .*\.config\..*
    reasoning: Looking for common entry point files like main.*, index.*, App.*, package.json, and config files that might indicate project structure and entry points
    ```
    Matching filenames: react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/theme/index.ts, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/index.js, react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m, server/src/main.py, react-native/android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/app.json, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/package.json
    ```🔍 Searching for substrings
    patterns:
      - "main":\s*"[^"]*"
      - "scripts":\s*\{
      - public static void main
      - if __name__ == "__main__"
      - def main\(
      - function main\(
      - export default
      - module\.exports
    reasoning: Searching for entry point patterns in various languages - Node.js main field, scripts in package.json, Java main method, Python main, JavaScript/TypeScript exports
    ```
    Files with content matching patterns: react-native/.eslintrc.js, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageProgressBar.tsx, react-native/.prettierrc.js, server/src/main.py, react-native/src/App.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Markdown.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/Parser.tsx, react-native/src/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomSendComponent.tsx, react-native/src/history/CustomDrawerContent.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/AudioWaveformComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/DropdownComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TabButton.tsx, react-native/src/prompt/PromptScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/useMarkdown.ts, react-native/jest.config.js, react-native/src/prompt/PresetPromptList.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/markdown/CustomCodeHighlighter.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/ImageSpinner.tsx, react-native/babel.config.js, react-native/metro.config.js, react-native/src/chat/component/CustomMessageComponent.tsx, react-native/src/settings/TokenUsageScreen.tsx, react-native/src/chat/component/HeaderTitle.tsx, react-native/src/chat/ChatScreen.tsx, react-native/package.json, react-native/src/settings/CustomTextInput.tsx

    # Planning
    I can see there are multiple programs in this project. Let me examine the main entry points to provide a comprehensive answer.
    ```❓ 
    filePaths:
      - server/src/*.py
    ```
    Added dynamic file summaries for: [server/src/image_nl_processor.py, server/src/main.py]
    ```🔍 Getting file contents
    filenames:
      - react-native/package.json
      - react-native/index.js
      - server/src/main.py
      - react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m
    ```

    ## Key Application Details
    
    ### React Native App:
    - **App Name:** "BropertyAi" 
    - **Version:** "2.4.0"
    - **Main App Component:** Located at `./src/App` (referenced in index.js)
    
    ### FastAPI Server:
    - **Port:** Configurable via PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
    - **Host:** "0.0.0.0" (all interfaces)
    - **Framework:** FastAPI with uvicorn server
    - **Main app instance:** `app = FastAPI()`
    
    These entry points represent the primary locations where debugging efforts should be focused, as they control the application startup and execution flow.

    # Main Programs, Executables, and Entry Points for Debugging
    
    This project contains multiple main programs and entry points across different platforms and technologies. Here are all the key entry points that might need debugging:
    
    ## 1. React Native Application Entry Points
    
    ### Primary JavaScript Entry Point
    - **File:** `react-native/index.js`
    - **Purpose:** Main React Native application entry point
    - **Key Code:** `AppRegistry.registerComponent('BropertyAi', () => App)`
    - **Imports:** App component from `./src/App`
    
    ### Main App Component
    - **File:** `react-native/src/App.tsx` (already in workspace)
    - **Purpose:** Root React component with navigation, theming, and providers
    - **Key Features:**
      - Navigation setup with drawer and stack navigators
      - Theme provider integration
      - App context provider
      - Toast notifications
      - Multiple screen components (ChatScreen, TokenUsageScreen, PromptScreen, etc.)
    
    ### iOS Native Entry Point
    - **File:** `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`
    - **Purpose:** iOS-specific native application entry point

    ## 2. Python FastAPI Server Entry Point
    
    ### Main Server Application
    - **File:** `server/src/main.py`
    - **Purpose:** Backend API server using FastAPI
    - **Key Code:** `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
    - **Server Startup:** `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", "8080")))`
    - **Configuration:** Configurable port via PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
    
    ### Image Processing Module
    - **File:** `server/src/image_nl_processor.py`
    - **Purpose:** Supporting module for image processing functionality
    - **Note:** May contain additional entry points or main functions for image processing tasks
    
    ## 3. Development and Build Entry Points
    
    ### Package.json Scripts (react-native/package.json)
    These are executable commands that serve as entry points for various development tasks:
    
    #### Development Entry Points:
    - `"start": "react-native start"` - Metro bundler for development
    - `"android": "react-native run-android"` - Android app launcher
    - `"ios": "react-native run-ios"` - iOS app launcher
    
    #### Build Entry Points:
    - `"build:ios": "cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace BropertyAi.xcworkspace..."` - iOS production build
    
    #### Testing/Quality Entry Points:
    - `"test": "jest"` - Jest test runner
    - `"lint": "npx eslint ."` - ESLint code linting
    - `"format": "npx prettier --check '*.{js,ts}'"` - Prettier code formatting check
    
    ## 4. Configuration Entry Points
    
    These configuration files can affect application behavior and may need debugging:
    
    - **react-native/jest.config.js** - Jest testing configuration
    - **react-native/babel.config.js** - Babel transpilation configuration  
    - **react-native/metro.config.js** - Metro bundler configuration
    - **react-native/.eslintrc.js** - ESLint linting configuration
    
    ## Application Details
    
    - **App Name:** "BropertyAi"
    - **Version:** "2.4.0" 
    - **Architecture:** React Native frontend with FastAPI Python backend
    - **Platforms:** iOS and Android mobile apps
    
    ## Debugging Priority
    
    For debugging purposes, focus on these primary entry points in order of importance:
    
    1. **React Native App (`react-native/src/App.tsx`)** - Main UI and navigation logic
    2. **FastAPI Server (`server/src/main.py`)** - Backend API and business logic
    3. **Platform-specific entry points** (`react-native/index.js`, `react-native/ios/SwiftChat/main.m`) - Platform initialization
    4. **Development scripts** (package.json scripts) - Build and development issues
    
    Each of these entry points controls different aspects of the application lifecycle and would be key locations for debugging application startup, runtime issues, or build problems.

  Please decide the next tool action(s) to make progress towards resolving the goal.
  
  You MUST think carefully before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls.
  DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
  
  You are encouraged to call multiple tools simultaneously, especially
  - when searching for relevant code: you can invoke callSearchAgent multiple times at once
  - when manipulating Workspace context: make all desired manipulations at once
  
  Conversely, it does not make sense to call multiple tools with
  - callCodeAgent, since you want to see what changes get made before proceeding
  - projectFinished or abortProject, since they terminate execution
  
  When you are done, call projectFinished or abortProject.

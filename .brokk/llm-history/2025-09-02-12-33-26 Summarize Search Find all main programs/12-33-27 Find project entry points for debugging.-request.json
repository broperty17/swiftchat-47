Here are\n   [Brokk's explanation of \"how does bm25 search work?\"](https://gist.github.com/jbellis/c2696f58f22a1c1a2aa450fdf45c21f4)\n   in the [DataStax Cassandra repo](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra/) (a brand-new feature, not in anyone's training set), starting cold\n   with no context, compared to\n   [Claude Code's (probably the second-best code RAG out there)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f77ea58-9fe3-4eab-8698-ec4e20cf1974).\n1. Automatically determine the most-related classes to your working context and summarize them\n1. Parse a stacktrace and add source for all the methods to your context\n1. Add source for all the usages of a class, field, or method to your context\n1. Parse \"anonymous\" context pieces from external commands\n1. Build/lint your project and ask the LLM to fix errors autonomously\n\nThese allow some simple but powerful patterns:\n- \"Here is the diff for commit X, which introduced a regression.  Here is the stacktrace\n  of the error and the full source of the methods involved.  Find the bug.\"\n- \"Here are the usages of Foo.bar.  Is parameter zep always loaded from cache?\"\n\n</text>\n<goal>\nSummarize the text in 5 words or fewer.\n</goal>\n"

      I can see you're getting a Gradle build failure when running `npx react-native run-android`. This error suggests there's an issue with Java compilation dependencies in the Android build configuration.
      
      To properly debug and fix this issue, I need to examine the Android build configuration files. Could you please **add these files to the chat**:
      
      1. `react-native/android/build.gradle` (project-level)
      2. `react-native/android/app/build.gradle` (app-level) 
      3. `react-native/android/gradle.properties`
      4. `react-native/android/settings.gradle`
      
      These files contain the build configuration and dependencies that are likely causing the compilation failure. Once I can see the current configuration, I'll be able to identify the issue and provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to fix it.
      
      Common causes of this error include:
      - Incorrect Android SDK/build tools versions
      - Missing or incompatible dependencies
      - Java/Kotlin version mismatches
      - Plugin configuration issues
      
      Please add those Android build files to the chat so I can diagnose the specific problem.

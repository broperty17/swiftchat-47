This error suggests there's an issue with Java compilation dependencies in the Android build configuration.\n    \n    To properly debug and fix this issue, I need to examine the Android build configuration files. Could you please **add these files to the chat**:\n    \n    1. `react-native/android/build.gradle` (project-level)\n    2. `react-native/android/app/build.gradle` (app-level) \n    3. `react-native/android/gradle.properties`\n    4. `react-native/android/settings.gradle`\n    \n    These files contain the build configuration and dependencies that are likely causing the compilation failure. Once I can see the current configuration, I'll be able to identify the issue and provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to fix it.\n    \n    Common causes of this error include:\n    - Incorrect Android SDK/build tools versions\n    - Missing or incompatible dependencies\n    - Java/Kotlin version mismatches\n    - Plugin configuration issues\n    \n    Please add those Android build files to the chat so I can diagnose the specific problem.\n  </message>\n  \n  <message type=custom>\n    \n    # Code Agent Finished\n    No edits found or applied in response, and no changes since last build; ending task.\n  </message>\n</task>\n\n"
